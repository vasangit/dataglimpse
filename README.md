This project is a robust data analysis and validation tool built using React for the frontend. Users can effortlessly upload CSV files, triggering a seamless process of data validation and visualization. Leveraging MUI for UI components and Recharts for data representation, the tool offers an intuitive interface for exploring and comprehending datasets. Beyond data integrity checks, it provides insightful visualizations and reports. A robust authentication system was implemented using MongoDB and Firebase Google Authentication to ensure secure user access. The application seamlessly integrates with a Python backend, showcasing my proficiency in React, Power BI, and Python Flask.
